- ✅ **Flask API**: RESTful endpoints for data sync and feature extraction  
- ✅ **Feature Extraction**: Automatic joining of all datasets with ML-ready features
- ✅ **Data Preservation**: Merges new data while keeping historical records
- ✅ **Backup System**: Automatic backups before each sync operation
- ✅ **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging

### 3. **Automatic Feature Extraction**
- ✅ **Dataset Joining**: Automatically joins transactions ↔ customers ↔ products ↔ shops
- ✅ **Feature Engineering**: Price differences, ratios, time-based features, customer behavior
- ✅ **ML-Ready Output**: CSV format ready for machine learning models
- ✅ **Real-time Processing**: Features updated with each new transaction

## 🔄 DATA FLOW WORKING PERFECTLY

1. **Flutter App** → Adds transaction locally (CSV format)
2. **Auto-Sync** → Monitors changes and syncs with ML backend  
3. **Data Merging** → Combines new data with existing data (no duplicates)
4. **Feature Extraction** → Joins all datasets and extracts ML features
5. **ML Backend** → Data ready for analytics and machine learning
6. **Backup** → Automatic backup created before each operation

- Product information (category, brand, price)
- Shop location data
- Transaction details (quantity, price, payment method)

### Calculated Features  
- `price_difference`: Actual - Standard price
- `price_ratio`: Actual / Standard price  
- `total_amount`: Quantity × Price
- `month`, `day_of_week`, `is_weekend`: Time-based features

### Customer Behavior
- `preferred_categories`: Customer preferences
- `avg_monthly_spending`: Spending patterns
- `visits_per_month`: Frequency analysis
